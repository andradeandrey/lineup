% lineup, a tiny queue server

  lineup is a queue server with lua event hooks
  meaning that every aspect of the server is
  totally scriptable.
  
  it's also designed to be as small, simple, and
  hackable as possible.

% protocol

  % client commands
  
    ---
    
    PUSH <priority> <message-length>\r\n
    <message>\r\n
  
    adds a new message to the queue.
    <priority> is the priority of the message. the lower
      it is, the higher priority the message has.
    <message-length> is the length in bytes of the
      <message> field.
    <message> is a binary blob of <message-length> bytes
      and is the data added to the queue.
    returns OK on success, in inline format
    returns an error message otherwise, in error format
  
    ---
    
    POP\r\n
  
    the take command removes the first job from the queue
    returns the message on success, in message format
    returns an error message otherwise, in error format

  % server responses:
  
    ---
    
    inline format
    
    inline format messages are prefixed with a + and end
    with a literal \r\n.
    
    example:
    
      +OK\r\n
      
    ---
    
    error format
    
    error format messages are prefixed with a - and end
    with a literal \r\n. this is to help clients
    differentiate between success and error messages
    without having to keep some sort of table.
    
    example:
    
      -Out of memory\r\n
      
    ---
    
    message format
    
    message format messages are prefixed with a $ and are
    followed by the size of the message in bytes, then a
    literal \r\n. then the binary blob of the message comes
    after that, also followed by an \r\n.
    
    example:
    
      $16\r\n
      A STUPID MESSAGE\r\n\
